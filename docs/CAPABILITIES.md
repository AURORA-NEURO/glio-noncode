# Capability coverage

GLIO-NONCODE is measured against the approved product blueprint, not against
the number of Python files or agent roles. The checked-in catalog at
`schemas/capability_catalog.csv` contains:

| Measure | Denominator | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Product capabilities | 256 | 16 domains × 16 ordered capabilities |
| MVP capabilities | 64 | The first four capabilities in each domain |
| Delivery surfaces | 4 per capability | Core, API, CLI, and review/operations surfaces |
| Feature instances | 1,024 | 256 capabilities × 4 delivery surfaces |
| Control-plane roles | 48 | Bounded agent responsibilities |
| Typed tool contracts | 96 | Two contracts per bounded role |

The 48-role and 96-contract figures describe orchestration coverage. They are
not a substitute for product implementation coverage. A capability is counted
as implemented only when the ledger names its modules; it is counted as
verified only when tests and the stated evidence boundary support that claim.
The registry reports planned, partial, implemented, and verified counts
separately so a single percentage cannot hide unfinished work.

## Domain 01 intake boundary

The first vertical slice covers the source boundary for case material:

- VCF, gVCF, TSV, JSON, and binary BCF intake preserve source hashes,
  headers, typed fields, genotype decisions, deferred symbolic records, and
  malformed-record issues;
- BED and narrowPeak coordinates are converted from zero-based half-open to
  one-based closed intervals, while GFF3 remains one-based closed;
- regulatory-track rows are converted to context-qualified candidate
  elements only when their source accounting remains intact; unresolved
  targets are explicitly marked rather than inferred;
- supported SNV/indel identities receive a VRS-shaped allele representation;
  missing reference digests, repeat ambiguity, and unsupported breakend/CNV/
  haplotype forms remain visible as limitations or abstentions.

These adapters are a research-use boundary. They do not assert clinical
interpretation, and a VRS-shaped local representation is not presented as a
RefGet-equivalent digest unless a sequence digest is supplied.

The command-line equivalents are:

```powershell
glio-noncode intake variants.vcf --output intake.json
glio-noncode parse-track regulatory.bed --output track.json
glio-noncode normalize 7:140453136:A>T --genome-build GRCh38
```

Every future capability wave must add implementation modules, fixtures,
negative or abstention cases, and review-facing evidence before its ledger
state is advanced.

## Domain 03 specimen context

The specimen-context plane keeps sample and specimen labels project-local and
declarative. It maps conflicting ontology rows as ambiguous, resolves a
matched normal only when the same subject has exactly one declared normal,
imports purity/ploidy tables with caller receipts, and flags declared
fingerprint conflicts while abstaining on incomplete contamination evidence.
These are local partial capabilities until locked canonical fixtures and
external calibration benchmarks are available.

## Domain 04 reference coordinates

The reference plane resolves assembly aliases separately from mapping
evidence. Chain-like tables are imported as explicit equal-length segments;
liftover scoring reports absent, unique, or competing mappings; and
pangenome coordinates retain every declared path candidate. The resolver
never treats a coordinate conversion as proof of sequence equivalence.

## Domain 05 regulatory atlases

The atlas extension parses ENCODE SCREEN-style cCRE records and supports
brain-cell, adult-glioma, and pediatric-glioma profiles over a bounded local
snapshot. Queries preserve source versions and raw hashes, gate on declared
cell state, disease, and age context, and distinguish supported overlap from
absence, ambiguity, and out-of-domain context. Atlas overlap is an annotation
observation, not proof of activity or causality.

## Domain 06 sequence and model adapters

The sequence plane emits deterministic context features separately from
external model outputs. Foundation-model and long-context adapters require
model/version and context-window metadata, validate reported deltas, retain
source hashes, and quarantine inconsistent rows. The delta ensemble reports
mean and disagreement by variant; it does not convert model output into a
probability or clinical interpretation.

## Domain 07 chromatin context

The chromatin plane keeps accessibility and histone observations tied to a
source snapshot and exact reference context. ATAC, DNase, histone, and H3K27ac
BED-like TSV/JSON rows preserve one-based normalized coordinates, assay kind,
replicate identifiers, signal values, raw hashes, and malformed-row issues.
Retriever queries require both interval overlap and an exact
`ReferenceContext.key`; an overlap from another disease, age, cell state, or
territory is reported as out-of-domain rather than reused.

Accessibility deltas are measured reference-to-alternate comparisons with
missing-value abstention and zero-baseline guards. H3K27ac is summarized as an
observation with replicate spread and ambiguity retained. Neither signal nor
delta is promoted to a causal effect, enhancer truth label, target-gene link,
or calibrated probability without external truth sets and assay-specific
validation.

The command-line boundary is:

```powershell
glio-noncode parse-chromatin accessibility.tsv --track-kind atac --output accessibility.json
```
