# GLIO-NONCODE

GLIO-NONCODE is a local-first research workbench for turning glioma non-coding variants and bounded structural events into inspectable regulatory hypotheses.

The first release slice is deliberately narrow and reproducible. It accepts a case manifest, canonical variant identities, context-qualified candidate regulatory elements, and typed numeric evidence inputs. It produces a dossier containing:

- decomposed variant → regulatory element → gene → cell-state paths;
- separate evidence claims for sequence, chromatin, topology, linking, state, cohort, and functional channels;
- explicit missing, negative, contradictory, out-of-domain, and abstained states;
- context transport and uncertainty for every claim;
- content-addressed inputs and outputs plus a hash-chained run event log;
- validation routes ranked by expected information gain and feasibility; and
- a research-use-only policy boundary with a human review gate.

This repository does not diagnose, classify clinical significance, recommend treatment, decide trial eligibility, or declare an individual variant actionable. A high-support hypothesis is a research object that requires expert review and independent validation.

## Quick start

```powershell
python -m pip install -e .
glio-noncode evaluate examples/case-small.json --output dossier.json
glio-noncode schema
```

The same runtime can be served locally:

```powershell
glio-noncode serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

Then send the JSON manifest to `POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/v1/evaluate`. `GET /healthz` reports service health and `GET /v1/schema` returns the contract summary.

## Design boundaries

The system treats a scalar score as a view, not as the ontology. Evidence is append-only, source dependence is grouped before aggregation, context transport is visible, and missing evidence is never silently converted to a negative result. Structural variation is represented as a first-class input kind even though the initial fixture focuses on a point variant.

Scientific quantities in this slice are deterministic transformations of supplied observations. The runtime does not invent measurements, claim that a generic annotation proves a glioma mechanism, or hide unsupported inputs behind a narrative.

## Repository layout

```text
src/glio_noncode/       typed domain, runtime, API, storage, and reports
schemas/                machine-readable public contract
examples/               small reproducible case manifest
tests/                  unit and integration coverage
docs/                   architecture, contribution, and release-boundary notes
.github/workflows/      automated quality checks
```

## Development

```powershell
python -m unittest discover -s tests -t . -v
python -m compileall -q src tests
```

The project uses only the Python standard library at runtime. Optional development tools may be added later behind explicit lockfiles and reproducibility checks.
